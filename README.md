BCO7006_Assessment_2 Brooke Kneebush 05.11.22

 PURPOSE
The purpose of this assessment task is to:

Using variables and data structure in your program
Using flow controlling and conditional statements
Using appropriate design and breakdown to write a program
Adopting to high coding standards
Using Git for keeping track of code changes and iteratively refining a program
The unit learning outcomes assessed are:

LO 1: Deconstruct business problems to develop programming solutions;
LO 2: Design, construct and implement programming solutions using open source tools;
LO 4: Investigate different programming solutions for appropriate business use; and,
LO 5: Communicate programming solutions in a collaborative programming environment and review their implementation in the business context.
 DETAILS
In this scenario, you will act as a business analyst and will be given a dataset. You need to use the knowledge learnt in the lectures to write a complete program to produce the output stated in the scenario document. More specifically, you will need to use the appropriate input(s) to read the data, use correct data types to store the data, write controlling and conditional statements (e.g. for-loops and if) to compute the results, and format the results according to the scenario document.

 INSTRUCTIONS 
To get started on your assessment task, please follow the below instructions.

Read the instruction below
In the CSV file in this repository, you can find a number of staff members and their salaries. Compute the following and display on the screen:

The average salary of staff members whose employee type is "Manager"
The full name of the staff member who has the lowest salary
Your Python program file should be named Your studentID_firstname. Use Python's string formatting to produce an output that is similar to the sample below.

Organise your code appropriately with the features provided by Python. Hint: Go through the lecture slides we have seen so far and think about what can be used in this assessment.

Also, you will be marked with Git commits and branches so make sure you use them while writing your code.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
The average salary of managers is 72,750 dollars.
Paul Innit has the lowest salary ($41000.00).

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
The following levels of criteria will be used to grade this assessment task:

Criterion 1: Conceptual correctness: Does the code address the problem? (30%)
Criterion 2: Programming approach: Does the solution show technical rigour? (25%)
Criterion 3: Readability: code is easy to understand, and complies with coding conventions, comments are provided to enhance comprehension (25%)
Criterion 4: Git: Using Git for version control to keep track of changes where appropriate (20%)
